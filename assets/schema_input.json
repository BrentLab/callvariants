What matters here is internal consistency in a given samplesheet -- let's say you have three groups of samples: a group which uses the input genome, a group which has marker_1 and a group with has marker_2. For the input genome group, you would maybe set `genome_name` to `input_genome`. For the marker_1 group, you would set `genome_name` to `input_genome_marker_1`. For the marker_2 group, you would set `genome_name` to `input_genome_marker_2`. The names are arbitrary. What matters is that the `genome_name` and `additional_sequence` entries are consistent within a set."
