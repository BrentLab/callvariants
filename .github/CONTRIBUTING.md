# Contributing

1. Please create a fork.
1. It would be a good idea to post a feature request or bug report prior to
beginning development.
1. On your fork, create a branch from `dev`. Keep your fork's `main` and `dev`
up-to-date with the official repository. ie, pull `main` and `dev`, and rebase
`main` to `dev` and your brach onto `dev`
1. When you are done adding a feature or fixing a bug, issue the pull request
from your branch to `dev`.
